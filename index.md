# Physics-Informed Neural Networks

In the constantly changing landscape of scientific research and computational methods, physics-informed neural networks, or PINNs for short, represent a fusion of physics-based modeling and machine learning techniques. These lecture notes will serve as a gateway to understanding the fundamental principles, applications, and potential of this interdisciplinary field.

When dealing with complex real-world problems, particularly those governed by physical laws, traditional numerical methods often face limitations in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability. This is where PINNs come in handy. By leveraging the power of neural networks, these innovative algorithms offer a new paradigm for tackling intricate problems that involve physical processes, without the need for expensive simulations or extensive experimental data.

Throughout these lecture notes, we will explore the core concepts behind PINNs, their underlying mathematical foundations, and their practical implementation. This resource will provide you with the knowledge and tools to harness the synergy between physics and deep learning.

We will delve into the crucial components of PINNs, including their architecture, loss functions, training strategies, and applications across various domains such as fluid dynamics, material science, and beyond. As we navigate through this terrain, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the transformative potential of PINNs and their role in shaping the future of computational science. These lecture notes aim to equip you with the knowledge and insights needed to grasp the full spectrum of possibilities that PINNs offer in advancing our understanding of the physical world.
